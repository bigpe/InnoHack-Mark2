# Welcome to generating system!

This generative system supports generating either single images, or a series of 6 images with progressive COVID-19 on it. 
Solution is based on https://github.com/brendon-ng/COVID-19-Affected-Lung-CT-Image-Generative-Network Demo. 

For the purpose of demostration you can use two commands in a command line:

### Generates a PNG with a sequence of lung images with COVID-19 progression on it
``` bash
python GAN_generation_COVID19.py --generation_type PROGRESSIVE
```
### Generates a single PNG image with lungs with COVID-19
``` bash
python GAN_generation_COVID19.py --generation_type SINGLE
```
It will produce a single image by default.

Please note that the solutions may suffer from the small dataset which is used for the demo purposes. The solution must be retrained for the production on more data.
